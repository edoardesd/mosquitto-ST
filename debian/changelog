    - Fixes CVE-2017-7653 (Closes: #911266)
  * Remove no longer needed patches. Some are integrated into upstream, others
    have been replaced with changes in rules.
    - async_dns.patch
    - build-timestamp.patch
    - disable-in-tree-uthash.patch
    - enable-libwrap.patch

    - Calls to invoke-rc.d to stop mosquitto will be inserted automagically by
      debhelper.
  * Stop removing the mosquitto user in postrm.
    - This is not safe since there might still be logs (and other files?)
      around owned by the uid, so we don't want it reused for a new user.
  * Add build dependency on libsystemd-dev.
  * Enable systemd build support.
  * Ship the mosquitto.service file (with sd-notify support)
  * Drop -dbg packages and do -dbgsym migration.
